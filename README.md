# FieldFoxVNA

Simple graphing program written for FieldFox VNA. Not the most user friendly at the moment, change the "FILENAME" variable and the graph_sparam arguements to title sparameter graphs nicely.


Data/lab1 has microstrip transmission line data, bandpass filter data etc. examples for what the graphs look like with matplolib.pyplot

Newest verison graphs every file in directory. As long as the naming convention in lab2 data folder is followed.
