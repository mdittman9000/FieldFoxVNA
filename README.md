# FieldFoxVNA

Simple graphing program written for FieldFox VNA. Not the most user friendly at the moment, change the "FILENAME" variable and the graph_sparam arguements to title sparameter graphs nicely.


Data/lab1 has microstrip transmission line data, bandpass filter data etc. examples for what the graphs look like with matplolib.pyplot
